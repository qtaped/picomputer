## What the f* is it?
A raspberry Pi Zero 2 with a weird wide screen and a 40% mechanical keyboard in a [3d-printed case](https://github.com/qtaped/picomputer/wiki/3dprint), inspired by [lisperati1000](https://github.com/drcode/lisperati-1000-diy).  
I am a graphic designer, not an engineer neither a developer. You have been warn!

> This project is at his early stage. It is not guaranteed to work. But it works. I guess.
